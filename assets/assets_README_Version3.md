- logo.svg: present in this branch (cleaned wordmark)
- handwriting.woff2: not included for licensing reasons. To enable the annotation handwriting effect, place a woff2 at assets/handwriting.woff2
- handwriting-notes.txt: placeholder file explaining where to put the font

How to add a handwriting font
1. Choose a font with a license that allows web hosting.
2. Convert to woff2 if necessary.
3. Place the file at: assets/handwriting.woff2
4. The CSS (css/styles.css) already has @font-face configured to use this file as "Marginalia".

License reminder
- Only add fonts you have the right to host. If you want, I can recommend a few free/open options and provide download links.
